              Developed and led by experts in the fields of social policy,
              social work, and urban studies, this course provides an
              introduction to work and social inclusion of migrants in the
              comparative urban contexts of Bangalore, Moscow and Oslo.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the course, we will use a visual and interactive approach to
              explore theories and methods for evaluating work inclusion
              measures, as well as the crucial strategies and factors that are
              often not considered. You will gain knowledge of how poverty may
              be understood and compared across the three settings and will
              learn alternative conceptual approaches to the more traditional
              income-focused one.

                  You will learn new ways to evaluate the work inclusion
                  strategies beyond those currently used. Our focus is on moving
                  beyond an income-only focus in order to improve the social
                  inclusion of target groups through work. Using a “situated”
                  work inclusion approach, the course will provide an
                  appreciation of the historical, social-material and
                  psychological factors shaping the success of inclusion methods
                  targeted to diverse and often marginalized populations and
                  identities.

                    methods and theories for understanding and measuring poverty

                  <li>
                    policy strategies and necessary considerations developing
                    inclusion measures
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    evaluation of current work inclusion measures using
                    alternative approaches to a focus on income

                  The course will move between different levels of experiences
                  shaping the success of work and social inclusion measures,
                  including a biographical approach to the everyday life of the
                  target group individuals, the factors of changing place and
                  space before and after migration, as well as the structural
                  and institutional factors shaping inclusion experiences. The
                  concepts and ideas you will learn will help you to reflect
                  upon current practices and improve practices for often
                  marginalized communities.
